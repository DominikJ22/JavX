## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, Vite, and OpenAI
I designed this app to have an elegant user face that resembles the ChatGPT app. It communicates with the GPT 3 model API and answers question and comments. I made a seperate client side and server side. I used simple js for both to make it a simple as possible.

## Optimizations
Simple server using Node.
Responsive layouts with CSS.
Simple handle events with JavaScript.

## Lessons Learned:
From this project I really focused on learning how to use Vite. Vite is a JS tool that helps simplify Frontend applications. The API used in this application was complicated to understand at first but after some time and research I understood how to impliment it. Finally, I learned and focused on how to deploy new apps with new technology.
